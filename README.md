## Synopsis

This project is a single-player tic tac toe game built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the class CSI3140

## Code Example

The game's logic is encapsulated within the JavaScript file (tictactoe.js). Here are some key functions:

- `handleClick(event, button_text)`: Manages the user's move.
- `computerPlay()`: Controls the computer's move.
- `scanGame(player)`: Checks the game state to determine if there's a winner or a draw.
- `handleStart(event)`: Resets the game and starts a new round.


## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to create a single-player game as a learning exercise for the CSI3140 class. This project helps to understand the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and how they can be used together to create a functional and enjoyable web-based game.

## Installation

1. Clone this git repository.
